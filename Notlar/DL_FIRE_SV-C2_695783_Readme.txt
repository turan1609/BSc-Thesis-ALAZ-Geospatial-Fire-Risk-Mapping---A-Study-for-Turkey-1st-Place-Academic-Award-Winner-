README: NASA FIRMS MODIS or VIIRS Fire/Hotspot Data Download
========================================================

If you requested data from multiple instruments e.g. MODIS (combined Aqua and Terra), VIIRS (S-NPP and/or NOAA-20, NOAA-21) and LANDSAT,
you will receive an email, with download link, for each data source.

This zip file will have either one, two or three naming conventions beginning with:
    DL_FIRE_M-C61_xxxx if you requested MODIS data (C61 stands for MODIS Collection 6.1), or 
    DL_FIRE_J1V-C2_xxx if you requested VIIRS 375m data from  NOAA-20(JPSS-1)
    DL_FIRE_J2V-C2_xxx if you requested VIIRS 375m data from  NOAA-21(JPSS-2)
    DL_FIRE_SV-C2_xxxx if you requested VIIRS 375m data from S-NPP
    DL_FIRE_LS_xxx if you requested LANDSAT 30m data


The xx refers to the download request id/number. The zip file contains the data
for the requested dates in your area-of-interest.

If you requested the data in shape file format you will see the following files
contained in your zip:
    fire_xx.dbf
    fire_xx.prj
    fire_xx.shp
    fire_xx.shx
    fire_xx.cpg
    Readme.txt

If you requested the data in CSV format the file name will look like this: 
    fire_.xx.csv
    Readme.txt

Depending on the date range selected you may receive 1 or 2 files containing
Near Real-Time (NRT) data and/or older standard/science quality data. NRT data
are replaced with standard quality data when they are available (approximately 3 months).

-- fire_nrt_M-C61_xx = MODIS NRT files:(MCD14DL) MODIS Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies
                    product processed by LANCE / FIRMS

-- fire_nrt_SV-C2_xx = VIIRS 375m NRT files:(VNP14IMGTDL) VIIRS Active Fire and Thermal
                    Anomalies product from S-NPP processed by LANCE / FIRMS

-- fire_nrt_J1V-C2_xx = VIIRS 375m NRT files:(VJ114IMGDL) VIIRS Active Fire and Thermal
                    Anomalies product from NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) processed by LANCE / FIRMS

-- fire_nrt_J2V-C2_xx = VIIRS 375m NRT files:(VJ214IMGDL) VIIRS Active Fire and Thermal
                    Anomalies product from NOAA-21 (JPSS-2) processed by LANCE / FIRMS

-- fire_archive_M-C61_xx = MODIS standard quality Thermal Anomalies / Fire locations 
                        processed by the University of Maryland with a 3-month
                        lag and distributed by FIRMS. These standard data (MCD14ML) 
                        replace the NRT (MCD14DL) files when available.

-- fire_archive_SV-C2_xx = VIIRS 375m standard Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies product
                        processed by the University of Maryland with a 3-month lag and
                        distributed by FIRMS. These standard data (VNP14IMGTML) replace
                        the NRT files (VNP14IMGTDL ) when available.

-- fire_nrt_LS_xx = LANDSAT 30m NRT files: LANDSAT Active Fire and Thermal
                    Anomalies product from LANDSAT


PLEASE NOTE the standard quality data is not yet available from FIRMS for NOAA-20 and NOAA-21

For the key differences between the NRT and standard products visit:  
https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/firms/faq and view question on 
â€œWhat are the key differences between URT/RT/NRT and standard quality fire data?â€

The MODIS and VIIRS fire files are split to ensure users clearly distinguish between
these two data sources. Should you wish to combine the datasets you will still be
able to distinguish the source using the Collection / Version field.
 
Please note: If your request results in no fire points, the accompanying ZIP file
will include an empty CSV file with a header, or an empty DBF file. If you believe
that this has occurred due to an error, please contact us at support@earthdata.nasa.gov.
